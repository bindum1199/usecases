1. Create folder 'Test' in your home directory​
    mkdir test

2. Create below files​
   - employeelist​
   
      touch employeelist
      ls -l

  - skillset​

      touch skillset
       ls -l

3. Create folder Test2 in home directory​
       mkdir Test2

  - create symbolink and hard link for skillset file 
     ln -s skillset symlink
     ls -l

      ln  skillset hardlink
      ls -l
​

  - delete skillset file and check if hardlink and symbolic link file exists​
     rm skillset

      ln skillset symlink
ln: failed to create symbolic link 'symlink': File exists

      ln  skillset hardlink
ln: failed to access 'skillset': No such file or directory

   - explain the difference b/n symbolic and hard links​
Symbolic link- creates a reference to the original file.
               inode number will be unique.
               If the file is deleted the symbolic link becomes invalid
Hardlink- creates a carbon copy of the file.
          will have same inode number.
          directly points to the file.

4. Provide read and write permission to 'user2' group​

   test if user2 group users can access the file​
           chmod g+r file1
           chmod g+w file1

5. Revoke write permission from user2 group and test the access again​
​           chmod g-w file1
           Access denied

6. Grant write permission for others and test it 
          chmod o+w file1

7. Revoke write permission for others and test again​
          chmod o-w file1
          Access denied

8. Change the group of employeelist file to 'user3'​ test if user3 group have access​
          chgrp user3 employeelist

9. Change ownership of the file to user5 and test​
          chown user5 file1

10. check how many employees are there  (hint: use wc command)​
           wc employees

*Create file “File1”​
   mkdir File1

*Append 2 more lines to the same file​
   cat >>File1
sonata software
hai

*Create File2 with few lines​
    mkdir File2
 cat >>File2
hello
welcome

*Display the contents of both File1 and File2​
    cat File1
    cat File2

*Concatenate both File1 & 2​
   cat File1 File2

*Send the above output to File3​
   cat File1 File2 > File3

*Read File1,File2,File3… File5 . Observe the output​
   cat File3 File4 File5 >File6

*Redirect the errors of the above command to “errorlog”​
   cp File6 2> errfile 
     
*Concatenate name File1 to 5 and store it in File 10. if any errors, log them in the same file ​
     cat File1 >> File5 
     cp File5 File10 2> File10

*Copy File1 to File6. Add the errors to “errorlog”​
       cp File1 File6 2> errfile
